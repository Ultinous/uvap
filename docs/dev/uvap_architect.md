# Architecture

UVAP implements a dataflow programming model. This way data is processed by
multiple simple processors (potentially running on different hosts) connected
by channels. This model is widely used in the video processing domain, for
example in
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a> or
<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org" target="_blank">gstreamer</a>.
UVAP uses
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache KafkaÂ®</a>
for data channels and
<a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a>
to run the processors. These technologies provide a generic and
flexible framework to build various stream processing applications.

The term _microservice_ is used hereafter for processors. The main use case of
UVAP is real-time video analysis, where all microservices run
continuously, processing potentially never ending data. A microservice can take
zero or more Kafka topics as input, and produce zero or more Kafka topics as
output. In Kafka terminology, they are _consumers_, _producers_ or _stream processors_.
Microservices are packaged and run in Docker containers.
Microservices typically process data in real-time, however it is possible to
run them on historical data.

The data channels between microservices are Kafka Topics. Head of the topics
are kept in a persistent storage for configurable time or size. For example,
the user can configure to keep the last two weeks of video data and keep all
object detentions for a year.

## Multi-Graph Runner

**Multi-Graph Runner (MGR)** runs all deep-learning-based image processing models
(for example, head detection or face recognition) on the video streams. **MGR**
outputs only lightweight data, such as head detection streams or face
recognition feature vectors. The uncompressed video data is never transferred
over Kafka, as it is only used to exchange lightweight data. All low-level
image processing is done inside **MGR**.

For further information, see the following topics:
* [Multi-Graph Runner microservice description]
* [Configuring Multi-Graph Runner]
* [Starting Multi-Graph Runner]

## Tracker

**Tracker** microservice uses the **`Head Detections`** topic produced by
**MGR** and produces the **`Track Changes`** topic. A track is a sequence of head 
detections of an individual on a video stream from the first detection to the
disappearance. Besides the path of movement, a track can help to calculate how
long an individual stays in an area of interest.
**Tracker** is a key feature for using **Pass Detector**.

For further information, see the following topics:
* [Tracker microservice description]
* [Configuring Tracker]
* [Starting Tracker]

## Pass Detector

**Pass Detector** microservice uses **`Track Changes`** topic produced by the
**Tracker** microservice and produces the **`Pass Detections`** topic. If one or
more directed polylines (pass lines) are specified in the microservice
configuration, the service detects and produces records whenever a track
intersects a pass line. **Pass Detector** helps to detect if an individual enters
or leaves an area of interest, for example; the queue area in a store.

For further information, see the following topics:
* [Pass Detector microservice description]
* [Configuring Pass Detector]
* [Starting Pass Detector]

## Reidentifier

**Reidentifier** microservice uses **`Face Feature Vectors`** topics
produced by **MGR** and produces **`Reidentification Events`** topic. An individual can
be registered at the first appearance on a camera stream and can be reidentified
later, even on a different camera stream. This can be very helpful at waiting
time estimation.
