 Configuration for kafka_reid.

 Concept:
   Inputs are feature vector streams that may be extracted from video camera images or from manually managed images.
   Feature vectors are registered, i.e. stored as a new identity when they are dissimilar to any other stored feature vector.
   Feature vectors are reidentified as an existing identity when they are similar enough to a registered feature vector.
   Each input stream can be used for registration, reidentification, or both.
   Examples:
   - Registering manually managed data: Loading staff database for entrance system.
   - Reidentification from  manually managed data: Searching for people similar to a given photo.
   - Registering data from camera: Dwell time measurement, first camera.
   - Reidentification from data from camera: Dwell time measurement, second camera.

   On reidentification, each stream that is used for registration will provide a top list of matches,
   the final result will be the concatenation of these top lists.
   Each top list has a maximum size configured for that registration stream (reid_max_count).
   A top list can be shorter if there are not enough matches reaching the minimum required score (reid_min_score).

   Registration only happens if the score of the closest match is less than reg_max_score.
   For manually managed streams we recommend this settinng to be 1 (one).
   Registrations are kept in memory for reg_retention_period milliseconds.

 Input: Can be any record type that contains feature vectors and associated model ids.
   For streams that are used for registration, input messages with an already existing key in memory will
   - delete the in-memory feature vector if the payload of the input message is empty
   - update the in-memory feature vector otherwise.

 Output: ReidentificationRecord
